# builder-model-generator
This plugin is used to automatically generate database entity classes.The purpose is to provide a plug-in that enables the automatically generated entity class to satisfy the builder design pattern, so that it is not necessary to call the setter method of different parameters multiple times when generating the entity object, because the constructor is split in multiple calls during the construction process. The JavaBean in question may be in an inconsistent state.At the same time, variable parameters are provided, and different construction methods are not required for different parameters.
